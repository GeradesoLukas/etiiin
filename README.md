Exactly The Item Info I Needed(ETIIIN) adds useful info some people might need and some might not... but that is the great part about configs, isn't it? It doesn't end here, though! There is easy mod support due to item tags. Modpack devs can add items to the tag if they are still missing the tooltips.

Current Features:
- Tooltips for Saturation and Nutrition
- Tooltips for Diets (Flexitarian, Pescetarian, Vegetarian, Vegan, Halal)
- Tooltips for Beehives and Bee Nests
- Tooltips for Durability
- Tooltips for Repair Cost
- Tooltips for Items that can be smelted using one Fuel (Burn time)
- Tooltips for Burn Speed
- Being able to turn off every Tooltip via the Config
- Being able to change between Text and Icons for Diets via the Config
- Many Item Tags to add other mod's items to support them


Planned Features:
 - Tooltips for Light Levels
Please write any Suggestions in the Comments and I will try to add them, if I like them!


How to add new Items to the Mod's Tags:
There are currently 6 Item Tags you should edit. Any items listed in them will be automatically supported. Stuff like Durability, Repaircost, Items per Fuel and Harvestlevel will automatically apply. Burnspeed and Food's effects are Hard-coded and can currently support no mods (will probably change). The only things you can customize are the Beehive and Diet Tooltips.

The names of the tooltips are: beehives.json; food_flexitarian.json; food_not_halal.json; food_prescetarian.json; food_vegan.json; food_vegetarian.json


Already Supported Languages:
